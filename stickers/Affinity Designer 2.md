# Affinity Designer Tips and Tricks 


## Leaves and Flowers

- Leaf: Create an ellipsis, Then convert to curves￼.  Select top and bottom, nodes and use the sharp tool.  Then use the middle nodes or add nodes and use the rounded tool to pull into the right shape 
- Flower pedals: use nodes to slightly tweak each one so they seem more natural looking ￼
