To avoid exporting images with excessive white space in Affinity Designer, you can use the following methods:

### Method 1: Resize the Artboard
1. **Select the Artboard Tool**: In the Tools panel, select the Artboard Tool (shortcut `Shift + O`).
2. **Adjust the Artboard Size**: Resize the artboard to fit the content exactly. You can manually adjust the edges or enter the exact dimensions in the Transform panel.
3. **Export the Artboard**: When you export, only the contents within the resized artboard will be included.

### Method 2: Crop to Selection
1. **Select Your Object**: Use the Move Tool (shortcut `V`) to select the object or objects you want to export.
2. **Crop to Selection**: Go to the `Document` menu and select `Clip Canvas`. This will crop the canvas to the bounds of the selected objects.
3. **Export**: Export the document as usual. The exported image will only include the cropped area.

### Method 3: Export Persona
1. **Switch to Export Persona**: Click the Export Persona icon in the top right corner of the interface.
2. **Create a Slice**: Use the Slice Tool to draw a slice around the object you want to export. Adjust the slice bounds to fit the object precisely.
3. **Export the Slice**: In the Slices panel, click the Export Slices button to export only the area within the slice.

### Method 4: Use Export Options
1. **Export**: Go to `File > Export` and select your desired format (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
2. **Area to Export**: In the Export settings, choose the appropriate area to export. Select "Selection without Background" or "Selection with Background" to ensure only the selected objects are exported without additional white space.

These methods should help you export your images from Affinity Designer without unnecessary white space.
